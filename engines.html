						<h2>Engine Maintenance</h2>
						<p>5 things you must do for proper Engine Maintenance</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/engineblock.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					Having a healthy, well maintained car is only possible with a well taken care of engine. Your engine needs to run smoothly to keep your vehicle in tip-top shape. 
					Do you know the basic things that need to be done to maintain your engine?
					 What kind of expenses can arise if your engine is not maintained correctly? A properly maintained engine can save you money,
					 improve your car’s performance, and make it last longer.<br>
					<b>Here are 5 engine maintenance tips that’ll help your engine run like new and extend the life of your car:</b>
					   
					   <ol>
						<li><b>Change your oil regularly</b><br>
							Engine oil lubricates engine parts and reduces friction to keep parts from wearing down. Most oils also have additives that help break down debris. 
							It traps all the dust and dirt, so they don't get into other parts of the car. Over time, the oil loses its ability to perform these functions. 
							That is why oil changes are so significant. Oil grade and change times are subject to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 
							Check your owner’s manual to verify how often you should change the oil. </li>
						<li><b>Change your air filter</b><br> 
							I know a lot of people turn down the recommendation for air filter changes when technicians try to upsell them. The truth is, although they are upselling you,
						it is still a necessity. Changing your car's air filter regularly extends your engine life because the air filter traps dirt and debris that can damage engine parts.
						Each vehicle manufacturer had different recommendations for how often air filters should be replaced. As always, check your owner’s manual for your vehicle's 
						recommendations. Your mechanic can also recommend when to change it depending on where you live or your driving habits. More frequent driving and driving in dusty
						 areas usually require more frequent air filter changes.
						</li>
						<li><b> Don't ignore your check engine light</b><br>
							Manufacturers put it there for a reason. I can't tell you how many times people come to my shop and when I ask how long the check engine light has been on, 
							the answer is usually weeks to months. Yes, sometimes it comes on for something minor like a bad sensor or a loose gas cap. However, it could also be something 
							little that could become major like a failing thermostat. A thermostat that is stuck open allows the coolant to continuously circulate and causes the engine to take longer to get to it's operating temperature. This can affect your engine's life.
                             A closed thermostat is a major problem because if the coolant can't circulate, the engine's elements build up heat and can cause severe damage.</li>
						<li><b>Replace your fuel filter</b><br>
							The fuel filter filters out junk from the fuel so that nothing enters the combustion chamber. A new clean filter allows a free flow of clean fuel to the fuel pump and engine. 
							This guarantees that there is less build-up inside the engine, keeping it running with optimum performance.</li>
						<li><b>Check for leaks</b><br>
							Take care of any leaks ASAP. If you are not paying attention and all the oil runs out, say goodbye to your engine. Your engine needs oil to run and without it, it will die.
						    Fix all leaks to avoid this problem.</li>
					</ol>

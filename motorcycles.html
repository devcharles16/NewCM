						<p>The Most Common Mistakes People Make When Buying A Motorcycle</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/motorcycle.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					So, you decided to buy a motorcycle. The thought of being on the open road with the wind blowing around you has gotten you all excited. 
					Hey, I don't blame you. As a rider, I can tell you it's well worth it. You feel free as you ride, and it makes you feel as if you're on a high.
					 Studies even show that motorcycle riders are less stressed and have increased brain health.
					 <br> 
					 However, before you go out and buy a motorcycle, make sure you don't make some of these common mistakes.
					  <br>
					
				<ol>
					<li><b>Buying before you ride.</b><br>
						Sure, having a motorcycle sounds excellent, but what if you can't get the hang of it? Or you get on the road, and you are afraid. Always try it out first by taking professional lessons.</li>
					<li><b>Choosing a bike way beyond your skill level.</b><br> 
						I get it. That Kawasaki Ninja looks super sporty and will go great with your new leather motorcycle jacket. But, if you are just starting out riding, you may not be able to handle the power 
						and speed that comes with it. Ask a salesperson for recommendations based on your skill level. </li>
					<li><b> Not having the proper gear</b><br>
						Make sure your gear, such as your helmet and protective jacket are DOT approved. All that wind in your eyes and road noise, especially from the motorcycle, 
						can affect your eyes and hearing. So be sure to get protective eyewear and protection for your ears.</li>
					<li><b>Not having the proper license</b><br>
						All states require a motorcycle license. You have to take a written test and a training course to ride any bike above 50cc in most states.</li>
					<li><b>Underestimating additional costs</b><br>
						Motorcycles are cheaper to buy than cars, but they also require maintenance more frequently. Bike gear can also cost quite a bit. You can get a helmet for $150,
						 but for a good quality helmet, expect to pay at least $$300.</li>
				</ol>
				Whether you are trading in your four wheels for two, or you'll just be adding a motorcycle to your existing transportation, be sure to do your research. Be safe while riding. 
				There are old bikers, and there are bold bikers, but there are no old bold bikers.<br>

						<h2>Transmission Flushes</h2>
						<p>Do you really need it? This will help you decide</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/coils.png" alt="" /></a>
					 At some point or another, your mechanic has probably suggested you do a transmission flush. Is it really necessary though?
					 It is usually recommended by your vehicles manufacturer on a schedule. Refer to your vehicle's owner's manual to check the recommendations. 
					 Everyone wishes they'd done one regularly as soon as they start to experience issues with their transmission.<br>
					 
					 What is a transmission flush?
                    A transmission flush is a process where all of the transmission oil is removed. A machine is used to force out all the dirt and debris then refills the transmission
					with new oil. This should not be confused with a drain and fill which still leaves old transmission oil within the transmission itself. <br>
					
					<b>Here's when you should have one done:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>If your vehicle manufacturer recommends it at specific intervals</li>
					<li>If your transmission fluid is burnt</li>
					<li>Problems shifting gears</li>
					<li>Slipping gears</li>
					<li>Car surging forward</li>
				</ul>
				    It is important however, to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic to make sure there are no existing transmission issues.
				    Some of the problems listed can be caused by other transmission issues.<br>
				   <b>How much does a transmission flush cost?</b> 
					   <br>A transmission flush could cost you anywhere from $100-$400. It all depends on the type of vehicle you have and your location.
					    Most people pay between $150 to $200.
					   
			  If you are looking for something more cost effective, there are also commercial products available for cleaning your transmission lines.

			</ul>

			A lot of mechanics do not recommend transmission flushes on older vehicles because so many people swear that their transmissions failed after a fluid flush. 
			Large peices of gunk and debris can from the transmission can get into the valve body and cause transmission problems.
			Whatever you decided, it is always a good idea to have your vehicle diagnosed by a professional.

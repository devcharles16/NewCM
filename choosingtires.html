						<h2>Tires</h2>
						<p>How to choose the right ones</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/tires.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					Sometimes, finding the right tires for your vehicle can be overwhelming. There are so many things you have to consider like terrain, weather, 
						or whether or not you'll be challenging your buddies to a race.<br>
					<b>Here are the main categories of tires:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Touring</li>
					<li>Performance</li>
					<li>All Terrain</li>
					<li>Winter</li>
					<li>Competition</li>
				</ul>
				   Within these categories, there are sub-categories such as the type of vehicle (car, truck, etc.), on or off road and type of racing.<br>
				   <b>So, how do you choose?</b> 
					   <br>Before you choose the type of tire you need, you'll want to figure out your tire size. You can find your tire size 
					   in the owner's manual for your vehicle, the driver's side door jamb or sometimes on your vehicle's window sticker.
					   It will look like this - P225/75R16. Let's break this down. 
					   
                 <ul>
					<li> <b>P</b> - The first letter is the type of tire. In this case, it's a passenger tire.</li>
					<li> <b>225</b> - The tire width in millimeters</li>
					<li> <b>75</b> - This is the aspect ratio (Height to Width)</li>
					<li> <b>R</b> - This represents the tire construction type. Here, it's radial. It could also have the letter D for Diagonal ply tire or B for Belted-Bias ply tire.</li>
					<li> <b>16</b> - This is the rim diameter. Here, it's 16 inches.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Touring</b> tires are your everyday tires. They are designed for all purpose driving so they have a longer thread life, are great for all season driving, and offer a smoother ride.<br>
			    <b>Performance</b> tires offer better handling on the road and feel like you are driving a sports car. However, because these tires aren't meant for everyday driving, they have a shorter thread life.<br>
				<b> All Terrain</b> tires are built for adventurous and off road driving. These tires don't ride smoothly like touring tires, but offer great off road traction for rough terrains.<br>
				<b>Snow</b> tires are specifically made for driving in ice, sleet and snow. The traction is designed for winter weather conditions. They are not made for everyday driving.<br>
				<b>Competition</b> tires are made for racing. They handle race tracks with ease and offer good handling. Unlike touring tires, they have a short thread life, but can also be used for everyday driving.<br>
